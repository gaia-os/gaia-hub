    "# Basic Ent Creator\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic workflow to stand up an **Ent**: a live digital twin of an agroecology/agroforestry project that helps you understand the state of your land and make decisions about it. It is a \"basic\" workflow because it allows you to customize and fine-tune an existing Ent model to your project, but does not allow you to modify the model or create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The capabilities that this workflow implements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interact with the Fangorn ontology to ensure that the crop/plant species, data sources, agricultural practices, outcomes of interest and external factors that are relevant for your project are represented.\n",
    "1. Create a project configuration file that represents your project.\n",
    "1. Add parameter tables for effect sizes relative to new entries in the ontology.\n",
    "1. Select the agent model that fits your project.\n",
    "1. Spin up an Ent and attach it to your project's private data assets.\n",
    "1. Generate an assessment and interpret its results and recommendations.\n",
    "1. Connect your Ent to the Fangorn network to get streaming parameter updates from peer nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow does not support modifying the internals of the model, that is, changing the functional form of the relationships between variables, nor adding new variables. We are working on an advanced workflow to help you do that. Meanwhile, for a thorough introduction to Ents and Fangorn for modelers, see the `Get Started` and `Indoor Agriculture Modeler's Lab` notebooks."

You use this notebook by replacing the ficticious inputs below with your project's real ones, and running it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, user inputs are represented as `CONSTANTS IN ALL CAPS` with comments where you should replace your own values for your project. These indicated like so:\n",

You are responsible for checking its outputs!\n",

    "## Your project and the Fangorn ontology\n",
    "\n",
    "Fangorn is a symbolic system: variables typically have interpretations in terms of concepts in an **ontology**, which are either hardcoded by the modeler or discovered by an algorithm. Fangorn assumes that all Ents use a common (global) ontology, which enables them to communicate parameters (ex: effect sizes) with each other. An Ent may have an ontology that disagrees with the global one; however, that will effectively mean that it's partially unable to communicate about those concepts with the rest of the network.\n",
